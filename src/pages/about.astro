    <h1>Un peu about me</h1>

    <p>Hi! I'm Maude (pronounced "mode").</p>
    <p>
      I'm a Senior Staff Engineer at <a href="https://slack.com/careers">Slack</a> where I founded and lead the backend performance infrastructure team 🚀.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm responsible for <b>large-scale load test tooling, performance regression monitoring,</b> and <b>successfully onboarding the world's largest companies to Slack.</b> Over the last {new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} years, I've helped the product scale from just 60,000 users per team to over 2 million 📈. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When I don't have my nose in a flamegraph, you can find me building strong, empathetic engineering cultures 👯‍♀️.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October 2020, I published <i>Refactoring at Scale</i> with O'Reilly Media, a blueprint for how technical leaders can successfully navigate large, complex refactors 📕.

      I was born in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?sca_esv=596413328&output=search&q=drummondville,+qc&source=lnms&entry=mc">Drummondville, QC</a> to a (very) French-speaking family. I didn't speak a lick of English until we moved to southern New Hampshire the summer before I started the second grade 🇨🇦.
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to Quebec to study computer science at McGill University in Montréal in the fall of 2011 👩🏻‍💻.
    </p>
    <p>
      Post-graduation, I moved to New York City, where I worked as a frontend engineer at Rent the Runway for a little over a year 🗽.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September 2016, I moved to San Francisco to start a new job at Slack 🌁.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years later, my husband and I fully embraced remote work, moving back to the east coast to be closer to family. We now live in New Hampshire in a cozy house with a big yard and a wild toddler 🏡.
