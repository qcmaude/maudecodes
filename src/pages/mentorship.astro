    <h1>Mentorship</h1>
    <p>🚨 As of September 2024, I'm at capacity and won't be able to take on new mentees. Please check back in a few months, or sign up to get updates to my <a href="./writing">Substack</a> to find out when I have availability again.</p>

    <h2>✨ Need a new perspective? Let me help!</h2>
    <p>If you are a <b>mid-career individual contributor</b> in a software role who's at an inflection point, then I'd love to chat with you! Maybe you're deciding whether to go into management or stay in an individual contributor role. Maybe you're figuring out how to make the leap to the next level. Either way, I'd love to help!</p>
    <h2>👩🏻‍💻 Why work with me? Great question!</h2>
    <p>
      I've hit those same inflection points half a dozen times in the last few years.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the span of just 15 months, my team went through <b>5 distinct managers</b> and one, big re-org. 😳 We eventually found more stability, but each of these shifts brought up the seemingly inevitable question: "Should I step into a management role for my team?" Teammates have frequently told me I have the skillset required, and that maybe I should consider a Tech Lead Manager (TLM) role. (I've resolved to say on the technical track, for now 😉.)</li>
      <li>In just under a decade, I've gone from <b>new grad</b> to <b>principal</b> engineer. I made the leap from <b>senior</b> to <b>staff</b> in early 2019, then more recently, to <b>senior staff</b> in 2021. With my recent (2024) move to GitHub, I'm now a <b>principal</b> engineer. I've helped tons of coworkers work towards senior, staff, and senior staff promotions over the past few years. I've sat on promotion committees and read countless promotion packets. 🎉 In fact, these are some of my favorites parts of the job!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>💭 We might not be a great fit if ...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You're looking for the quickest way to rise up the ranks. I'm all for achieving goals quickly, but my approach is more about what you're getting out of your career as a whole than about maximizing title and compensation.</li>
      <li>You're not totally sure what you're looking for. Because I'm only taking on a few folks at a time, I want to make sure we're both committed to getting <i>somewhere</i> within just a few sessions. Ideally, there are some important questions that have been weighing on you that you'd like help working out the answers to.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How it all works ✍️</h2>
    <p>
      I currently have openings for <b>ad-hoc</b> mentorship sessions from now through early November 2024. Afterwards, I anticipate picking up new clients on a longer-term basis, starting in February 2025.
    </p>
    <h3>Meet & Greet</h3>
    <p>Let's make sure we're a good match before making any commitments! Meet with me for a 30 min session (completely free) so we can talk about your goals and whether I can help you achieve them.</p>
    <p> <s>🗓️ Book time <a href="https://calendar.app.google/JSf8JExwYPLMhnN68">here</a></s>. See note above about availability. Check back again soon!</p>
    <h3>Sessions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Ad-hoc</b> clients meet with me for 50 minutes. A single session costs $150. You can buy a 3-pack to use within 5 weeks for $400.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Long-term</b> clients meet with me for 50 minute sessions, 6 times over 3 months. The total cost is $750.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In our first session, we'll set up a general <b>game plan</b> for our time together, and go from there.
    </p>
